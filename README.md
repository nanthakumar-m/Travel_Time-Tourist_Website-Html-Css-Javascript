# ✈️ Travel Time – Tourist Website

Travel Time is a beautifully designed and interactive tourist website that showcases a wide range of trip packages to various international destinations. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project acts like a digital travel guide — helping users explore and discover their next travel adventure with ease.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my skills in front-end development, including UI/UX design, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity.
